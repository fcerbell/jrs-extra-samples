The install script expects :
- One dump file for each database
- Dump files to be named "<database>.sql" (case sensitive)
- Each dump create with the following command :
  pg_dump --clean -f <database>.sql <database>
- Each dump file might eventually be gziped and MUST have the following name "<database>.sql.gz"
  gzip <database>.sql
