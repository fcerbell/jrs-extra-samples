The install script expects :
- One dump file for each database
- Dump files to be named "<database>.sql" (case sensitive)
- Each dump file might eventually be gziped and MUST have the following name "<database>.sql.gz"
- Each dump create with the following command :
  pg_dump --clean <database> > <database>.sql
  or
  pg_dump --clean <database> | gzip -9 > <database>.sql.gz

Should you need to import it manually, you can use the following commands :
zcat <database>.sql.gz | psql <database>
cat <database>.sql | psql <database>
